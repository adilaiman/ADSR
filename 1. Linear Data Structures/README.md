## 1 Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures are collections of data orderered depending on how they are added or removed, such examples of data structures are: **queues**; **deques** and **lists**. Once the item is added, it stays in that position relative to other elements that comes before or after it.

Linear structures can be thought of having two ends: "left" and "right". Linear structures differ through how items can be added and removed.
